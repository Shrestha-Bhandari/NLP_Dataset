    "abstract": "Catalyzing and sustaining momentum for long-term research investments can be a challenge, especially for enteric pathogens like ETEC and Shigella that are most threatening to the health of children in low-resource areas, and whose vaccines would not be for global use. The 2018 Vaccines Against Shigella and ETEC (VASE) Conference included a workshop focused on building the capacity of scientists to communicate about their own research and advocate for additional attention and funding for enteric disease and vaccines research. Workshop presenters shared best practices and examples of advocacy, communications, and messaging tactics that have been used successfully during early stages of vaccine development research for other pathogens. The presentations were followed by an interactive, hands-on training for real-life communication opportunities for scientists that could result in increased research funding, including developing resonant messaging for relevant audiences and practicing interviews.",
