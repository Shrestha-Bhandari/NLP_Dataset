    "abstract": "Recent projections suggest that by 2035 global health will look dramatically different than it does today. In what's called a \u2018grand convergence\u2019 the world is likely to be characterized by far more similarities than differences in the prevailing health and medical problems across populations. This manuscript considers how key drivers for vaccine use and uptake might change as a result of the grand convergence and how decisions taken now might anticipate those changes in ways that position immunizations to continue playing an important role in the future.",
