    "abstract": "We assessed the cost-effectiveness of offering catch-up vaccination with Bexsero against meningococcal disease to children too old to receive the vaccine under the recently introduced infant programme. Offering catch-up vaccination to increasingly older children is less economically attractive because of declining disease burden. We estimate catch-up vaccination of 1\u00a0year old children could be cost-effective, incremental on the infant programme with a vaccine price of \u2a7d\u00a38 per dose. Extending vaccination to 2\u00a0year olds could only be cost-effective (incremental on infant and 1\u00a0year old catch-up) with a vaccine price of \u2a7d\u00a33 per dose and was not cost-effective in sensitivity analyses with more conservative vaccine assumptions. Extending catch-up further to 3\u20134\u00a0year olds was not cost-effective. Employing the current criteria for assessing vaccines, our models suggest that even with low vaccine prices only catch-up vaccination in 1\u00a0year old children could be cost-effective, when considered incrementally on the infant programme.",
