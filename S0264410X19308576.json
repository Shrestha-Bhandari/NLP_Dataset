    "abstract": "In response to global interest in the development of a universal influenza vaccine, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, PATH, and the Global Funders Consortium for Universal Influenza Vaccine Development convened a meeting of experts (London, UK, May 2018) to assess the role of a standardized controlled human influenza virus infection model (CHIVIM) towards the development of novel influenza vaccine candidates. This report (in two parts) summarizes those discussions and offers consensus recommendations. This article (Part 1) covers challenge virus selection, regulatory and ethical considerations, and issues concerning standardization, access, and capacity. Part 2 covers specific methodologic considerations. Current methods for influenza vaccine development and licensure require large costly field trials. The CHIVIM requires fewer subjects and the controlled setting allows for better understanding of influenza transmission and host immunogenicity. The CHIVIM can be used to identify immune predictors of disease for at-risk populations and to measure efficacy of potential vaccines for further development. Limitations to the CHIVIM include lack of standardization, limited access to challenge viruses and assays, lack of consensus regarding role of the CHIVIM in vaccine development pathway, and concerns regarding risk to study participants and community. To address these issues, the panel of experts recommended that WHO and other key stakeholders provide guidance on standardization, challenge virus selection, and risk management. A common repository of well-characterized challenge viruses, harmonized protocols, and standardized assays should be made available to researchers. A network of research institutions performing CHIVIM trials should be created, and more study sites are needed to increase capacity. Experts agreed that a research network of institutions working with a standardized CHIVIM could contribute important data to support more rapid development and licensure of novel vaccines capable of providing long-lasting protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.",
