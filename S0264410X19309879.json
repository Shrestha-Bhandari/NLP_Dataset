    "abstract": "Background: In 2016, Australia introduced the \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d legislation, which removed the option of non-medical exemptions from the vaccination requirements to receive certain family and child care tax benefits. We aimed to gauge parental support for \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d and explore how it has impacted parental attitudes towards vaccination, particularly among families that are reliant on the tax benefits linked to vaccination under \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d. Methods: An online survey distributed to parents with children under 5 in Australia assessed parental knowledge and opinions towards childhood vaccination and the \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d policy. Results: A total of 411 parents completed the survey. The majority of parents reported their child was either fully vaccinated or they intended to fully vaccinate. Eighty-two percent of parents were in favour of \u201cNo Jab, No Pay.\u201d The belief that vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant risk to unvaccinated children was a predictor of supporting the \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d policy (AOR = 5.95, 95% CI = [3.60, 10.94], p < 0.001). Parents that depend on the financial benefits associated with \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d and parents that utilize child care services were significantly more likely to reconsider vaccination, if they previously hesitated or objected, because of the policy (AOR = 9.66, 95% CI = [4.98, 18.72], p < 0.001 and AOR = 2.09, 95% CI = [1.04, 4.17], p = 0.04). Conclusion: We found that there is widespread support for \u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d among parents of young children, but parents that depend on the financial benefits or utilize child care services may be disproportionately affected by the policy. Childhood vaccination coverage in Australia could best be improved by increasing access to vaccination services and by imposing significant administrative barriers to obtaining non-medical exemptions.",
