    "abstract": "Background: The World Health Organization recommends the development of affordable next-generation inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) using attenuated poliovirus Sabin strains. Previously, we introduced a novel PER.C6\u00ae cell culture platform, which allows for high yield production of an affordable trivalent Sabin IPV vaccine. Methods: Immunogenicity and safety of this novel PER.C6\u00ae-based Sabin-IPV (sIPV) was assessed in rats and non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs received one of four different dose dilutions vaccine according to current human schedule (three prime-immunizations and one boost immunization). For comparison, NHPs received commercially available reference Salk IPV or sIPV. Results: Dose-dependent immunogenicity and good tolerability was observed for the PER.C6\u00ae-based sIPV formulations in rats and NHPs. In NHPs, the lowest tested dose that induced anti-Sabin virus-neutralizing antibody titers that were non-inferior to commercial sIPV after three immunizations was 5-7.5-25 D-antigen units for type 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Discussion: PER.C6\u00ae-based sIPV induced comparable immunogenicity to commercial Salk IPV and sIPV vaccines in NHPs. Together with the absence of any preclinical safety signals, these data warrant further testing in clinical trials. sIPV produced on the PER.C6\u00ae cell platform could be one solution to the need for an affordable and immunogenic IPV to achieve and maintain global polio eradication.",
