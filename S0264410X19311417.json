    "abstract": "Background: Vaccination strategies against bacterial meningitis vary across countries. In the United States, a single dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended at 11\u201312 years of age, with a booster dose approximately 5 years later. We assessed immune responses to a booster dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccine after priming with MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D vaccines in adolescents and adults. Methods: In this phase IIIb, multicenter, open-label study, healthy 15\u201355-year-olds, who received MenACWY-CRM (N = 301) or MenACWY-D (N = 300) 4\u20136 years earlier or were meningococcal vaccine-na\u00efve (N = 100), received one MenACWY-CRM vaccine dose. Immunogenicity was evaluated pre-vaccination, 3 or 5 days post-vaccination (sampling subgroups), and 28 days post-vaccination by serum bactericidal activity assay using human complement (hSBA). After vaccination, participants were monitored for 7 days for reactogenicity, 29 days for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), and 181 days for serious AEs and medically-attended AEs. Results: Sufficiency of the immune response to a MenACWY-CRM booster dose was demonstrated; the lower limit of the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval for percentages of participants with hSBA seroresponse at 28 days post-vaccination was >75% for each serogroup in those primed with either the MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D vaccine. Seroresponse was observed in \u226593.24% of primed participants and \u226535.87% of na\u00efve participants 28 days post-vaccination. At 5 days post-booster, among primed participants, hSBA titers \u22651:8 were achieved in \u226547.14% of participants for MenA and in \u226585.52% of participants for MenC, MenW and MenY, and 3.25- to 8.59-fold increases in hSBA geometric mean titers against each vaccine serogroup were observed. No safety concerns were raised throughout the 6-month follow-up period. Conclusions: A booster dose of the MenACWY-CRM vaccine induced a robust and rapid anamnestic response in adolescents and adults, irrespectively of either MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D vaccine administered 4\u20136 years earlier, with an acceptable clinical safety profile.
