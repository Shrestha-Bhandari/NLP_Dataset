    "abstract": "The present study aimed to develop monitoring methods for shallow water sessile and mobile epifauna with the main focus on enhancing the chance of early detection for new non-indigenous species (NIS) invasions. The field sampling was conducted between June and September in 2012, in the Archipelago Sea (Finland). The tested monitoring methods included baited traps that capture organisms and habitat collectors that provide habitat and refuges for organisms, as well as fouling plates. Catch efficiency of a trap/collector was defined as the number of NIS and all species caught, including their abundances. The American collector with oyster shells (habitat collector) caught the highest number of NIS, and their use is recommended in all places, where oyster shells are easily accessible. Sampling of all habitats of interest between 1 and 2 m depth is recommended with at least three habitat collectors per site.",
