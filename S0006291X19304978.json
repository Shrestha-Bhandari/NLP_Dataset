    "abstract": "We report the production and application of a recombinant IgCw molecule, which is composed of only the constant domains of the heavy (CH) and light (CL) chains, lacking a variable (V) domain. We produced IgCw, especially human IgCw-\u03b3\u03ba (98 kDa), composed of two human C\u03b3 chains (37 kDa each) and two C\u03ba chains (12 kDa each), using HEK293F cell culture. We found that the yield of IgCw-\u03b3\u03ba protein was \u223c20 mg/L, which was comparable to that of full-size IgG; it bound to Fc\u03b3 receptor-positive cells with a low background noise on Fc\u03b3 receptor-negative cells; and IgCw-\u03b3\u03ba can be used as a reference for measurement of Ig concentration. Moreover, C\u03b3 and C\u03ba chains were easily isolated from IgCw-\u03b3\u03ba by a single step of affinity chromatography in the presence of a reducing agent. These results demonstrate that the IgCw molecule has the potential to be used for certain in vitro and in vivo applications as an alternative to an irrelevant isotype control IgG, and to be used a favorable antigen for acquiring isotype-specific antibodies by immunizing animals.",
