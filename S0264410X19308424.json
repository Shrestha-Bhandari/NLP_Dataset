    "abstract": "Background: Two MenB vaccines with different dosing schedules are approved in the US: MenB-4C (2 doses) and MenB-FHbp (2\u20133 doses). Both vaccines were licensed on the basis of immunogenicity demonstrated after vaccine series completion. We evaluated vaccination completion and adherence to dosing schedules. Methods: This retrospective analysis used data from MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (Commercial) January 1, 2015 - February 28, 2018 and Multi-State Medicaid Database (Medicaid) January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2017 to examine vaccine series completion and adherence to dosing schedule in individuals who initiated a MenB series at ages 16\u201323 years. Vaccine series completion and dose schedule adherence were assessed during a 15-month follow-up period after the first dose. Completion was defined as individual receipt of the recommended number of doses, with current recommendations applied retroactively to allow individuals who initiated the MenB-FHbp series to be complete with either the 2- or the 3-dose schedule. Results: The study population comprised 65,205 commercially-insured individuals (36,118 initiated MenB-4C; 29,087 initiated MenB-FHbp) and 13,535 Medicaid-covered individuals (10,153 initiated MenB-4C; 3382 initiated MenB-FHbp). In Commercial, 63% of individuals who initiated MenB-4C and 52% of individuals who initiated MenB-FHbp completed vaccination within 15 months; dosing schedule adherence was 62% for MenB-4C initiators and 18% for MenB-FHbp initiators. In Medicaid, 15-month completion rates for MenB-4C and MenB-FHbp initiators were 49% and 31%, respectively, with corresponding dosing schedule adherence of 48% and 8%. Among individuals who completed the series, median time to completion was 68 days for MenB-4C versus 258 days for MenB-FHbp in Commercial and 88 days for MenB-4C versus 309 days for MenB-FHbp in Medicaid. Conclusion: During the study period, MenB vaccine series completion was suboptimal. However, completion was significantly higher for MenB-4C, with notably shorter time to completion. This may reflect the flexible dosing schedule of MenB-4C.",
