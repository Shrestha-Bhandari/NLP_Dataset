    "abstract": "The transient analysis of sliding beams represents a challenging problem of structural mechanics. Typically, the sliding motion superimposed by large flexible deformation requires numerical methods as, e.g., finite elements, to obtain approximate solutions. By means of the classical sliding spaghetti problem, the present paper provides a guideline to the numerical modeling with conventional finite element codes. For this purpose, two approaches, one using solid elements and one using beam elements, respectively, are employed in the analysis, and the characteristics of each approach are addressed. The contact formulation realizing the interaction of the beam with its support demands particular attention in the context of sliding structures. Additionally, the paper employs the sliding-beam formulation as a third approach, which avoids the numerical difficulties caused by the large sliding motion through a suitable coordinate transformation. The present paper briefly outlines the theoretical fundamentals of the respective approaches for the modeling of sliding structures and gives a detailed comparison by means of the sliding spaghetti serving as a representative example. The specific advantages and limitations of the different approaches with regard to accuracy and computational efficiency are discussed in detail. Through the comparison, the sliding-beam formulation, which proves as an effective approach for the modeling, can be validated for the general problem of a sliding structure subjected to large deformation.",
