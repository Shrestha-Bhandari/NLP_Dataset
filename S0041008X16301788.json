    "abstract": "Evaluation of the reducing capacity of human gastric fluid from healthy individuals, under fasted and fed conditions, is critical for assessing the cancer hazard posed by ingested hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and for developing quantitative physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models used in risk assessment. In the present study, the patterns of Cr(VI) reduction were evaluated in 16 paired pre- and post-meal gastric fluid samples collected from 8 healthy volunteers. Human gastric fluid was effective both in reducing Cr(VI), as measured by using the s-diphenylcarbazide colorimetric method, and in attenuating mutagenicity in the Ames test. The mean (\u00b1\u00a0SE) Cr(VI)-reducing ability of post-meal samples (20.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cr(VI)/mL gastric fluid) was significantly higher than that of pre-meal samples (10.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cr(VI)/mL gastric fluid). When using the mutagenicity assay, the decrease of mutagenicity produced by pre-meal and post-meal samples corresponded to reduction of 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 and 25.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cr(VI)/mL gastric fluid, respectively. These data are comparable to parallel results conducted by using speciated isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Cr(VI) reduction was rapid, with >\u00a070% of total reduction occurring within 1\u00a0min and 98% of reduction is achieved within 30\u00a0min with post-meal gastric fluid at pH\u00a02.0. pH dependence was observed with decreasing Cr(VI) reducing capacity at higher pH. Attenuation of the mutagenic response is consistent with the lack of DNA damage observed in the gastrointestinal tract of rodents following administration of \u2264\u00a0180\u00a0ppm Cr(VI) for up to 90\u00a0days in drinking water. Quantifying Cr(VI) reduction kinetics in the human gastrointestinal tract is necessary for assessing the potential hazards posed by Cr(VI) in drinking water.",
