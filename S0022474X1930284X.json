    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a recently discovered fumigant for postharvest pest control on fresh and stored products. Nitric oxide fumigation also does not leave residues on fresh fruit and vegetables when conducted properly. In this study, we analyzed nitrate (NO3\u2212) and nitrite (NO2\u2212) levels in liquid extracts and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) desorption rates as residues of NO fumigation at various times after fumigation on nine stored grain and nut products. Each product was fumigated separately with 3.0% NO for 24 h in two treatments: one treatment (NO\u2013N2) was terminated with nitrogen gas (N2) flush and the other (NO-Air) was terminated with normal air flush. For NO\u2013N2, NO3\u2212 concentrations of all fumigated products were not significantly higher than those of untreated controls at 1, 7, and 14 d after fumigation. NO2\u2212 concentrations of all fumigated products from N2 gas flush were not significantly higher than those of control products at 14 d after fumigation. NO2 desorption rates for most products from NO\u2013N2 treatment showed no significant difference from those for the controls 1 d after NO fumigation, except for beans and wheat, which showed no significant difference at \u22657 d after fumigation. All products from NO-Air treatment, however, had significant higher NO3\u2212 and NO2\u2212 ion concentrations in liquid extracts at 14 d after fumigation than those from NO\u2013N2 treatment and the control. NO2 desorption rates in all products from NO-Air treatment were also significantly higher than those from NO\u2013N2 treatment and the control at 21 d after fumigation. Therefore, when terminated properly with N2 flush, NO fumigation did not result in significant increases of NO3\u2212, NO2\u2212, or NO2 as residue in nut and grain products.",
