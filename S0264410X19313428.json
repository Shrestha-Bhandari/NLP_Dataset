    "abstract": "Cholera still affects about three million people a year and kills approximately 100,000. Cholera can be effectively managed in the majority of cases with oral rehydration solution alone. Up to one third of patients present with severe dehydration, which can be diagnosed clinically, and will require rapid intravenous rehydration with Ringers Lactate or other appropriate fluid before being managed with oral rehydration solution. Antibiotics reduce the duration of illness and should be used in patients with severe dehydration. Resistance is common and local sensitivities should guide the choice of antibiotic. All children between six months and five years should receive zinc supplements. Effective case management with strict attention to detail including infection control and the use of protocolized approaches can reduce the mortality to around 1% even in resource poor settings.",
