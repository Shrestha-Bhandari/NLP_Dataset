    "abstract": "The effect of machining on stress corrosion crack initiation of annealed Type 316L stainless steel was investigated through accelerated testing in high-temperature hydrogenated water. It was observed that stress corrosion cracks only initiated on machined surfaces with machining marks perpendicular to the loading direction and a porous inner oxide layer was identified as an important factor contributing to crack initiation. Furthermore, most cracks stopped within the machining-induced near-surface ultrafine-grained layer and the machining-induced residual stresses did not appear to have a significant effect on crack initiation. A correlation between crack initiation and the surface/near-surface features is identified and discussed.",
