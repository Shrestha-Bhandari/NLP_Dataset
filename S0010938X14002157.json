    "abstract": "This review summarizes the corrosion inhibition of steel materials in acidic media. Numerous corrosion inhibitors for steels in acidic solutions are presented. The emphasis is on HCl solutions, lower-grade steels, and elevated temperatures. This review is also devoted to corrosion inhibitor formulation design - mixtures of corrosion inhibitors with (mainly) surfactants, solvents, and intensifiers to improve the effectiveness of individual compounds at elevated temperatures. The information presented in this review is useful for diverse industrial fields, primarily for the well acidizing procedure, and secondly for other applications where corrosion inhibitors for steel materials are needed. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.",
