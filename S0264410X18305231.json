    "abstract": "Background: Japan licensed the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, Vaxem\u2122 Hib, based on clinical studies using subcutaneous injection. The present study was performed to ensure this vaccine is suitable for intramuscular injection in Japanese children. Methods: Thirty-one healthy 2\u20136-month-old infants received three doses of Vaxem\u2122 Hib by intramuscular injection at 4-week intervals and a booster dose 1 year later, concomitant with routine infant (DTaP-IPV and pneumococcal) and toddler (measles\u2013rubella) vaccines. Immunogenicity was assessed before and after the primary series and booster dose by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP) antibodies. Safety was assessed by medical examination and diary cards completed by the subjects\u2019 parents/legal guardians. Results: There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events or withdrawals; all children completed the study. Four weeks after the primary series, the geometric mean anti-PRP titer (GMT) was 19.68 \u03bcg/mL, and all children had seroprotective titers (\u22650.15 \u03bcg/mL) that persisted until the booster dose. Proportions of titers indicative of long-term protection (\u22651.0 \u03bcg/mL) were 100% after the primary series and 77.4% before the booster. Anamnestic responses to the booster had a GMT of 51.33 \u03bcg/mL, and 100% had titers \u22651.0 \u03bcg/mL. All but one subject reported injection site reactions as resolved within 3 days of vaccination; systemic reactions due to Hib and routine vaccines were also resolved within this period. Conclusions: Vaxem\u2122 Hib was generally well tolerated and immunogenic in Japanese children when administered by intramuscular injection in a three-dose primary series and as a booster with concomitant routine vaccines.
