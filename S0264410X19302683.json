    "abstract": "Diarrhea remains one of the top five causes of disease and death among young children in developing nations. Fortunately, scientists are making progress developing vaccines against enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shigella, two of the leading diarrhea pathogens. As vaccine developers start to consider field efficacy trials of these vaccines, they should be aware of the importance of evaluating not only vaccine direct effects on the immunized, but also the herd effects that vaccination can afford to the unimmunized in a community. In a workshop held at the conference titled \u201cVaccines against Shigella and ETEC (VASE)\u201d, we described to participants what herd effects are and we presented on methods used in cholera and rotavirus studies that could be useful for future ETEC and Shigella vaccine trials conducted in low and middle-income nations. We also presented evidence on the effects of vaccine herd effects for estimates of vaccine cost-effectiveness.",
