    "abstract": "To describe hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence and associated factors in adolescents (10\u201319 years) and young adults (20\u201325 years) in different Mexican regions, using 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey data. A random selection of 1581 serum samples was analyzed. Weighted HAV seroprevalence with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and its association with sociodemographic factors were estimated. Mean weighted HAV seroprevalence was 69.3% (95%CI: 64.8\u201373.4) overall, with 58.8% (95%CI: 53.4\u201364.1) in adolescents and 83.0% (95%CI: 75.3\u201388.7) in young adults. By age of 10, 46.7% (95%CI: 33.9\u201360.0) were seropositive and by age of 15, 52.8% (95%CI: 36.5\u201368.5), corresponding to intermediate endemicity nationally. Factors associated with HAV seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio, aOR) included: lower socioeconomic status (SES) (aOR = 4.09 for low and aOR = 2.31 for medium versus high SES), older age (aOR = 0.29 for adolescents versus young adults), living in the South (aOR = 2.12 versus Central Mexico) or in rural areas (aOR = 2.25 versus urban areas). Regional differences and increased seroprevalence of HAV in marginalized populations present an important public health issue, as a relatively large proportion of young adults are susceptible to infection. The burden of symptomatic disease must be addressed further to support specific programs of continued sanitation and education improvement, and the possibility of vaccination in more susceptible regions.",
