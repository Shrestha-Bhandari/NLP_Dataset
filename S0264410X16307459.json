    "abstract": "Introduction In September 2015, Nigeria was removed from the list of polio-endemic countries after more than 12\u00a0months had passed since the detection of last wild poliovirus case in the country on 24 July 2014. We are presenting here a report of two polio seroprevalence surveys conducted in September 2013 and October 2014, respectively, in the Kano state of northern Nigeria. Methods Health facility based seroprevalence surveys were undertaken at Murtala Mohammad Specialist Hospital, Kano. Parents or guardians of children aged 6\u20139\u00a0months, 36\u201347\u00a0months, 5\u20139\u00a0years and 10\u201314\u00a0years in 2013 and 6\u20139\u00a0months and 19\u201322\u00a0months (corresponding to 6\u20139\u00a0months range at the time of 2013 survey) in 2014 presenting to the outpatient department, were approached for participation, screened for eligibility and asked to provide informed consent. A questionnaire was administered and a blood sample collected for polio neutralization assay. Results Among subjects aged 6\u20139\u00a0months in the 2013 survey, seroprevalence was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51\u201366%) to poliovirus type 1, 42% (95% CI 34\u201350%) to poliovirus type 2, and 52% (95% CI 44\u201360%) to poliovirus type 3. Among children 36\u201347\u00a0months and older, seroprevalence was 85% or higher for all three serotypes. In 2014, seroprevalence in 6\u20139\u00a0month infants was 72% (95% CI 65\u201379%) for type 1, 59% (95% CI 52\u201366%) for type 2, and 65% (95% CI 57\u201372%) for type 3 and in 19\u201322\u00a0months, 80% (95% CI 74\u201385%), 57% (49\u201363%) and 78% (71\u201383%) respectively. Seroprevalence was positively associated with history of increasing oral poliovirus vaccine doses. Conclusions There was significant improvement in seroprevalence in 2014 over the 2013 levels indicating a positive impact of recent programmatic interventions. However the continued low seroprevalence in 6\u20139\u00a0month age is a concern and calls for improved immunization efforts to sustain the polio-free Nigeria.",
