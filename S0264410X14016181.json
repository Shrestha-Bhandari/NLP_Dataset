    "abstract": "This article presents the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations for the use of vaccines against diseases caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV) from the WHO position paper on Human papillomavirus vaccines: WHO position paper - October 2014, recently published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record [1]. This position paper summarizes the most recent developments in the field of HPV vaccines and the WHO position on HPV vaccine schedules in females. This document replaces the first WHO position paper on vaccines against diseases caused by HPV published in 2009 [2]. Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. This paper reflects the recommendations of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization. These recommendations were discussed by SAGE at its April 2014 meeting.",
