    "abstract": "Background: Since 2016, the Government of Tanzania has been implementing TImR, an integrated Electronic Immunization registry-logistics management information system (EIR-LMIS) that includes stock notifications. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of this intervention on vaccine availability. Methods: Monthly stock-out data were collected from paper registers at facilities, an Excel-based system at districts, and the new system (TImR) across all 924 health facilities in Arusha, Tanga and Kilimanjaro Regions. Six months of stockout rates pre- and post-introduction, by antigen, were compared via a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A mixed-effects logistic regression model with the TImR data identified predictors of vaccine availability across antigens. Findings: Post-introduction, ANOVA models estimated that overall stock-out rates declined from a monthly average of 7.1% to 2.1% (p < 0.01). Three specific vaccines had fewer stock-outs; OPV's monthly average dropped from 12.5% to 2.1% (p < 0.01), MR from 9.4% to 1.0% (p < 0.01) and DTP-HepB-HiB from 8.1% to 1.7% (p < 0.01). In the mixed-effects logistic regression model, controlling for antigen, odds of stock-out were 4.1% (95% CI: 3.3 \u2013 4.9) lower for each week of tenure. Compared to DTP-HepB-HiB vaccine, odds of BCG vaccine being stocked out were 4.31 as high (95% CI: 3.1 \u2013 5.0). The odds of being stocked-out were 29.7% lower for PCV (95% CI: 8.8 \u2013 45.8) and 26.6% (95% CI: 3.4 \u2013 44.1) lower for rotavirus vaccines compared to DTP-HepB-HiB. The odds of stock out were 37.7% lower for MR vaccine than DTP-HepB-HiB (95% CI: 18.1 \u2013 52.6). Conclusions: Tanzania's integrated EIR-eLMIS may increase vaccine availability compared to its paper and Excel based system. Post-introduction of an eLMIS, the odds of a vaccine stock-out reduced over time. Further research could determine the impact of this intervention on vaccine wastage and replenishment response times.",
