    "abstract": "Background: We report the first-in-concept human trial of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity when a novel TLR 7/8/RIG I agonist RNA-based adjuvant, CV8102, was administered alone or mixed with fractional doses of a licensed rabies vaccine (Rabipur\u00ae) as model antigen. Methods: The primary objective was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of various dose levels of CV8102 alone or mixed with Rabipur\u00ae in healthy 18\u201340 year-old male volunteers. A secondary objective was to assess the immune-enhancing potential of bedside-mixes of CV8102 with fractional doses of Rabipur\u00ae by measuring induction of rabies virus neutralising titres (VNTs). Results: Fifty-six volunteers received 50\u2013100 \u03bcg CV8102 alone (n = 11), bedside-mixed CV8102 and Rabipur\u00ae (n = 20), or Rabipur\u00ae alone (n = 25; control). When given alone or mixed with Rabipur\u00ae CV8102 caused mostly Grade 1 or 2 local or systemic reactogenicity, but no related SAEs. As 100 \u00b5g CV8102 was associated with marked CRP increases further dose escalation was stopped. Combining 25\u201350 \u00b5g of CV8102 with fractional doses of Rabipur\u00ae significantly improved the kinetics of VNT responses; 50 \u00b5g CV8102 also improved the magnitude of VNT responses to 1/10 Rabipur\u00ae but caused severe but self-limiting influenza-like symptoms in 2 of 14 subjects. Conclusions: Doses of 25 and 50 \u00b5g CV8102 appeared safe and with an acceptable reactogenicity profile while significantly enhancing the immunogenicity of fractional doses of rabies vaccine.
