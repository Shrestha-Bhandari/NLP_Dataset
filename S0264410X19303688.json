    "abstract": "Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIMs) now exist for several infectious diseases. CHIMs offer significant insight into disease pathogenesis, as well the potential to rapidly test clinical proof-of-concept of vaccine candidates. The application of CHIMs to identify a correlate of protection that may reduce the sample size of, or obviate the need for clinical efficacy studies to achieve licensure is of considerable interest to vaccine developers and public health stakeholders. This topic was the subject of a workshop at the 2018 Vaccines Against Shigella and ETEC (VASE) conference, in the context of O-antigen-based Shigella vaccines.",
