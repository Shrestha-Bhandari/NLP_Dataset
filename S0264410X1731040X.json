    "abstract": "Context From December 2015 to August 2016, a large epidemic of cholera affected the fishermen of Lake Chilwa in Malawi. A first reactive Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV) campaign was organized, in February, in a 2 km radius of the lake followed by a preemptive one, conducted in November, in a 25 km radius. We present the vaccine coverage reached in hard-to-reach population using simplified delivery strategies. Method We conducted two-stage random-sampling cross-sectional surveys among individuals living in a 2 km and 25 km radius of Lake Chilwa (islands and floating homes included). Individuals aged 12 months and older from Machinga and Zomba districts were sampled: 43 clusters of 14 households were surveyed. Simplified strategies were used for those living in islands and floating homes: self- delivery and community-supervised delivery of the second dose. Vaccine coverage (VC) for at-least-two-doses was estimated taking into account sampling weights and design effects. Results A total of 1176 households were surveyed (2.7% of non-response). Among the 2833 individuals living in the 2 km radius of Lake and the 2915 in the 25 km radius: 457 (16.1%) and 239 (8.2%) lived in floating homes or on islands at some point in the year, respectively. For the overall population, VC was 75.6% and 54.2%, respectively. In the 2 km radius, VC was 92.2% for those living on the lake at some point of the year: 271 (64.8%) used the simplified strategies. The main reasons for non-vaccination were absence during the campaign and vaccine shortage. Few adverse events occurring in the 24 h following vaccination was reported. Conclusions We reached a high two-dose coverage of the most at-risk population using simplified delivery strategies. Because of the high fishermen mobility, regular catch-up campaigns or another strategy specifically targeting fishermen need to be assessed for more efficient vaccines use.",
