    "abstract": "Background Broad use of monovalent Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines based on the capsular polysaccharide polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (PRP), has significantly reduced invasive Hib disease burden in children worldwide, particularly in children aged <1 year. In Japan, PRP conjugated to tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) vaccine has been widely used since the initiation of public funding programs followed by a routine vaccination designation in 2013. Methods We compared the immunogenicity and safety of PRP conjugated to a non-toxic diphtheria toxin mutant (PRP-CRM197) vaccine with the PRP-T vaccine when administered subcutaneously to healthy Japanese children in a phase III study. Additionally, we evaluated the immunogenicity and safety profiles of a diphtheria\u2013tetanus acellular pertussis (DTaP) combination vaccine when concomitantly administered with either PRP-CRM197 or PRP-T vaccines. The primary endpoint was the \u201clong-term seroprotection rate\u201d, defined as the group proportion with anti-PRP antibody titers \u2a7e1.0 \u03bcg/mL, after the primary series. Results Long-term seroprotection rates were 99.3% in the PRP-CRM197 group and 95.6% in the PRP-T group. The intergroup difference (PRP-CRM197 group \u2013 PRP-T group) was 3.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.099\u20137.336), demonstrating that PRP-CRM197 vaccine was non-inferior to PRP-T vaccine (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the \u201cshort-term seroprotection rate\u201d (anti-PRP antibody titer \u2a7e0.15 \u03bcg/mL) before booster vaccination was higher in the PRP-CRM197 group than in PRP-T. Concomitant administration of PRP-CRM197 vaccine with DTaP vaccine showed no differences in terms of immunogenicity compared with concomitant vaccination with PRP-T vaccine and DTaP vaccine. Although CRM197 vaccine had higher local reactogenicity, overall, both Hib vaccines had acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. Conclusion The immunogenicity of PRP-CRM197 vaccine administered subcutaneously as a three-dose primary series in children followed by a booster vaccination 1 year after the primary series induced protective levels of Hib antibodies with no safety or tolerability concerns.
