    "abstract": "The Indo Gangetic delta is homeland for cholera for almost two centuries now and there is evidence of global spread from this area. With migration of people to more urban areas within the country and increase in international travel, it is time for action against cholera in India, given its capacity to present itself in epidemic proportions. The Global roadmap to end cholera by 2030 was launched by the WHO Global Task force for Cholera Control which has led to renewed vigor and convergence of stakeholders across the world against the disease. There is also an emphasis on cleanliness and improved sanitation by the current government. The article discusses the unique opportunity for India in the current scenario, to act against diseases like cholera and challenges that are anticipated in deployment of interventions due to suboptimal surveillance and shortage of vaccines.",
