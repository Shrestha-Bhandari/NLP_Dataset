    "abstract": "We used manually spawned, field-deployed embryos of a common marine fish species, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), to evaluate accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with an incomplete creosote-treated piling (CTP) removal project. Embryos near undisturbed 100-year-old CTPs (before removal) accumulated higher PAHs and exhibited higher cyp1a gene expression than embryos from reference areas. Embryos incubated close to CTP debris after CTP removal showed PAHs 90 times higher than reference areas up to a year after CTP removal. cyp1a fold-induction correlated with total embryo PAHs in all three years. Patterns of individual PAH chemicals differed slightly between embryos, wood sampled from CTPs, and passive samplers. This study illustrates the importance of using appropriate techniques and procedures to remove CTPs in aquatic environments to prevent release of toxic chemicals. Of particular concern is that incomplete CTP removal could expose sensitive life stages of fishes to chemicals that may reduce their survival.",
