    "abstract": "Steel\u2013Concrete Composite (SCC) structural systems are increasingly used in the construction industry and becoming the subject of intensive research by the world's leading universities and companies because of their efficient material usage. This review paper summarises some historic and recent developments as well as the new trends for SCC systems. It presents the design philosophy and specific definitions for basic structural elements, including composite beams and slabs with emphasis on the applications, static tests, modelling techniques, design approaches as well as current design limitations. This paper concludes with a call for more research for the improvement of Eurocode 4, which in turn can help the fast-growing construction industry to take full advantage of the benefits of composite construction techniques implemented with safety.",
