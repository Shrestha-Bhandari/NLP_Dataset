    "abstract": "New vaccine candidates entering the current routine immunization schedule can best be accommodated as combination vaccines. A combined Shigella and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) vaccine could greatly benefit children in disease-endemic areas. New candidates are getting closer to being able to meet these needs, but they raise numerous strategic questions related to presentation, formulation, and regulatory approach. The \u201cCombination Vaccine Strategies to Prevent Enteric Infections\u201d workshop at the 2016 Vaccines Against Shigella and ETEC (VASE) Conference examined some of the considerations for developing such vaccines against enteric pathogens.",
