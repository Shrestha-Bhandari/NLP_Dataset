    "abstract": "The reaction of unirradiated-U with liquid water under deuterium overpressure was studied by conducting nine separate reactions at different temperatures. Post-corrosion examination of the surfaces was conducted using FIB, SIMS and XRD. Measurements of the reacting-water pH and sample degassing were made after the experiments were stopped. Isotopic labelling allowed better investigation of the mechanisms occurring in this system. The analyses showed that bulk-UH3 forms at the metal-oxide interface. The observed gas evolution reduction in the headspace was attributed to gas suppression of hydrogen generated through oxidation, and not D2 gas migration through the water. This suppression facilitates UH3 formation.",
