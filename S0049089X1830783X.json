    "abstract": "The neighbourhood environment has repeatedly proven to be a relevant context for central aspects of individuals\u2019 lives, such as educational attainment. The conventional approach of measuring neighbourhood characteristics within disjunct geographical units fixed at a particular scale is less suitable for representing the characteristics of individual action spaces in everyday activities and for detecting scale-dependent relationships. We, therefore, adapted an ego-centred context approach by aggregating contextual characteristics within (approximately) circular areas around individual respondents\u2019 places of residence (ego-hoods). We also used an analytical framework that considers the quality of hierarchical context effects. This allowed us to derive conclusions about the spatial reference of micro-level mechanisms from the scale of context effects observed as a macro\u2013micro relationship. We linked contextual indicators to individual-level data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Comparing ego-hoods of different ranges, we confirmed the expectation of distance decay in the relevance of neighbours for individual educational aspirations.",
