    "abstract": "This study characterizes the refreezing process of deformed ice. Twenty laboratory experiments in ice ridge consolidation were conducted to study the influence of ridge blocks size, initial temperature, and top surface roughness on the consolidation rate. Experiments covered a ridge block thickness range of 2\u20136 cm, initial block temperatures from \u22121 \u00b0C to \u221223 \u00b0C, ridge sail height up to 3 cm, and consolidated layer thickness up to 14 cm. Experiments were conducted with the average value of the convectional heat transfer coefficient of 20 W/m2K. The presented analytical model for ridge solidification was able to predict the observed ice growth rates and differences between level ice and consolidated layer thicknesses at different stages of the experiments. For the provided experiments, the consolidated layer was as much as 2.2\u20132.8 times thicker than the surrounding ice level. The consolidation rate was lower than in the analytical solution at the start of the experiment and approached the analytical solution only when the thickness of the surrounding level ice was larger than the ridge void width. The developed numerical model confirmed the observed experimental effects from the block size, initial temperature and surface roughness. Both numerical and analytical models can predict solidification rates for previous studies at the large range of scales for both fresh and saline ice. The advantages of the simplified experimental ridge geometry include high accuracy of the main parameters governing the process, including the ridge macroporosity.",
