    "abstract": "Poor oxidation performance of Ti-based alloys is an important life-limiting factor for high temperature applications. In this paper, a combinatorial approach is used to investigate systematically the influence of composition and time on the oxidation of Ti-Cr system. A compositionally graded Ti-. xCr specimen (0 \u2264 x\u226440. wt%) was prepared and oxidized at 650. \u00b0C. The structure and composition of the oxide and near-surface region were studied and a critical composition of ~20. wt% Cr was identified above which the oxidation resistance is enhanced. Below the critical composition transition to a rapid breakaway oxidation was observed for extended exposure times.",
