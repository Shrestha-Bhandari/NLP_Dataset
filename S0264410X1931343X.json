    "abstract": "Background: The economic burden data can provide a basis to inform investments in cholera control and prevention activities. However, treatment costs and productivity loss due to cholera are not well studied. Methods: We included Asian countries that either reported cholera cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 or were considered cholera endemic in 2015 global burden of disease study. Public health service delivery costs for hospitalization and outpatient costs, out-of-pocket costs to patients and households, and lost productivity were extracted from literature. A probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis was conducted for key outputs using Monte Carlo simulation. Scenario analyses were conducted using data from the WHO cholera reports and conservative and liberal disease burden estimates. Results: Our analysis included 14 Asian countries that were estimated to have a total of 850,000 cholera cases and 25,500 deaths in 2015 While, the WHO cholera report documented around 60,000 cholera cases and 28 deaths. We estimated around $20.2 million (I$74.4 million) in out-of-pocket expenditures, $8.5 million (I$30.1 million) in public sector costs, and $12.1 million (I$43.7 million) in lost productivity in 2015. Lost productivity due to premature deaths was estimated to be $985.7 million (I$3,638.6 million). Our scenario analyses excluding mortality costs showed that the economic burden ranged from 20.3% ($8.3 million) to 139.3% ($57.1 million) in high and low scenarios when compared to the base case scenario ($41 million) and was least at 10.1% ($4.1 million) when estimated based on cholera cases reported to WHO. Conclusion: The economic burden of cholera in Asia provides a better understanding of financial offsets that can be achieved, and the value of investments on cholera control measures. With a clear understanding of the limitations of the underlying assumptions, the information may be used in economic evaluations and policy decisions.",
