    "abstract": "Does ethnic diversity increase or reduce white threat perceptions? Meta-analyses help orient a field and communicate findings to policymakers. We report the results of a meta-analysis of studies measuring the relationship between ethnic context and both opposition to immigration and support for anti-immigration parties. Our analysis attempts to be exhaustive, and is based on 171 post-1995 studies averaging 25,000 observations each, a knowledge base of over 4 million data points. We find a linear association between ethnic change and elevated threat. However, for diversity levels, the relationship between ethnic context and threat is nonlinear. This takes the form of a \u2018wave\u2019 with higher diversity predicting threat responses at the smallest and largest scales, whereas in units of 5000\u201310,000 people (such as tracts or neighbourhoods), diversity is associated with reduced threat.",
