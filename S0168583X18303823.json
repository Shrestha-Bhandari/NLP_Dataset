    "abstract": "The Versatile Arc Discharge and Laser Ion Source (VADLIS) is a recently established ion source for the CERN-ISOLDE radioactive ion beam facility. It offers either electron-impact ionization (VADIS-mode) or resonance laser ionization (RILIS-mode). The choice of operating mode depends on the element of interest or the required beam purity. Particle-in-cell simulations using the VSim software show that the ion extraction efficiency of the VADLIS in RILIS-mode can be improved if it is equipped with an insulated extractor plate, to which an optimal voltage can be applied. This enables optimization of the RILIS-mode ion extraction independently of the electron density. Experiments have been performed using a prototype VADLIS with an adjustable extractor plate voltage for the generation of gallium ion beams at the off-line separator as well as magnesium, molybdenum and mercury ion beams at ISOLDE. A factor >2 increase of the VADLIS efficiency in RILIS-mode has been achieved.",
