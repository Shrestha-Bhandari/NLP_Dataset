    "abstract": "An in situ ion irradiation transmission electron microscope has been developed and is operational at Sandia National Laboratories. This facility permits high spatial resolution, real time observation of electron transparent samples under ion irradiation, implantation, mechanical loading, corrosive environments, and combinations thereof. This includes the simultaneous implantation of low-energy gas ions (0.8-30 keV) during high-energy heavy ion irradiation (0.8-48 MeV). Initial results in polycrystalline gold foils are provided to demonstrate the range of capabilities. \u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",
